                <h3>My background</h3>
                <p>
                  While doing a student exchange programme in Portugal, I discovered the world of IT and immediately fell in love with it. 
                  Especially with the idea of creating whatever my imagination offers me and thus solving real world problems. 
                  Since then I have never stopped learning.</p>
                <h3>My goals</h3>
                <p>
                  Currently I'm learning more about devOps tools and designing to polish my full stack skills. 
                  In future I plan to learn more about AI and ML and improve my Python knowledge as well as mobile dev. understanding. 
                </p>
                <h3>My skills</h3>
                <p>
                  Until this point I acquired 3 years of professional experience as a full stack software developer building medical softwares. 
                  For such purposes I used React, Redux, Flux, Node, Express, graphql, REST, C#, .NET, postgres, MS server db, mongo db and others. 
                  I used Figma for designing and Jira, Github and Jenkins for developing processes. 
                  I have also worked with Python, Django, Flask and React native.
                </p>
